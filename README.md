## Abstract ##
The operators at SOS Alarm receives thousands of calls each day at the
different emergency medical communication centres, owned by SOS Alarm, all over
Sweden. A subset of these calls contain room for improvement and the operators
could learn to improve from these calls.  The work of finding – and analysing –
these calls is however too tedious to be done by a human. This thesis presents
four automatised solutions to this issue. The human factor is removed and the
job of finding and analysing the calls is done by a computer.

It is shown that it is possible to partly automatise the analysis, but the
methods used have different strengths and weaknesses. Word frequency analysis
is proven adequate at key word look- up. Similarity comparisons of various
aspects of the calls are proven good at classifying calls, but less good at
answering specific questions. Comparing parse trees seems promising, but the
technology needs more work before it is ready to be used.

The solutions presented show that it could be possible to automatise the
analysis of the calls given that the right questions are asked and the results
from these are used appropriately.
